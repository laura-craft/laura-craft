        <h6>June 10, 2020</h6>
        
        <p >This is my first blog post. I'm new to this whole blog thing, but here I go.  I'm an almost 50 year old mom with 2 kids; Dani and Billy. Dani is 23 and Billy is 20.  I've been married for 24 years and my husband's name is Bill. We met when I was 19 and he was 29.  We were really good friends for about 5 years before we started dating. We eventually got married, obviously. I grew up in San Jose, California and lived there until I got married and moved to Modesto.  We currently live in the Central Valley of California, Modesto, and have lived here for 23 years.  I used to teach computers Kinder thru 8th grade, but I currently work as a Staff Secretary at an elementary school.</p>

        <p>I grew up in San Jose, CA.  I went to an all girl Catholic High School named Notre Dame High School.  The school is located in the heart of Silicon Valley, so naturally we were one of the first schools to be able to test the new Apple Computers.  Mind you, this was in the late 80's, definitely not the computers of today. <br> One of my first jobs was working at a Computer Leasing company which was kind of a big deal back then, every company was leasing computers instead of purchasing every 5 years. After we moved to Modesto, I taught computers to Kinder thru 8th grade. I taught them everything from history of the computer & typing, MS Office to Adobe Photoshop. <br> My kids have always encouraged me to learn how to code since I love working with computers so much, so here I am.

        <h6>June 11, 2020</h6>
        
        <p>Coding is definitely a brand new adventure for me.  Sure I've seen the jumble of letters and numbers and characters when I accidentally click on something that takes me to some funky screen, but actually being able to decipher that crazy mess is definitely an adventure.  My old brain hasn't been used like this in a long time!  lol  It's like learning a new language, which btw, I was never really good at when I tried to learn Spanish.  I'm currently also learning sign language, which has been a blast, but difficult to say the least.  I'm excited to see if my old brain can handle this rigorous memorization and application of this new (to me) language.  In the meantime, if you speak to me, please don't judge if my English is compromised.</p>

        <p>I'm not even sure how to answer that because assuming I'm admitted into the program, I'm not sure who would hire a 50 year old woman.  Maybe someone somewhere needs some games for old timers to be created, who knows. I guess we'll see!</p>
